## So, what's next:
This is a project we built in 1-2 weeks. It's not polished, needs a lot of restructuring in here and we're gonna do that. That aside, it's open from now on. If you feel like Contributing or say, just viewing to learn something, read the CONTRIBUTING.md file, that has all the instructions on how to successfully setting up this whole project.

Also, do not forget to read the README.md files in ```/frontend``` and ```/backend``` directories.

Thanks for visiting. 😊
