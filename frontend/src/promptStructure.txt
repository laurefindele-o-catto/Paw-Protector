- Vaccination history: [list vaccines + dates]  
- Deworming history: [last deworming date + product used]  
- Current symptoms (emphasis for diagnostics): [user form data]  

Format:  
1. Likely causes or differential diagnoses (ranked by likelihood).  
2. Possible supportive/home care measures (safe, general advice).  
3. Red‑flag symptoms that require urgent vet consultation.  
4. Preventive or follow‑up tips.  

Extra Instructions:
