Pet First Aid

Bleeding
1. Keep your pet calm by speaking gently and approaching quietly. 2. With clean hands, explore your pet to identify the source of the bleeding. Take care; an animal in pain may bite. 3. Using a clean towel or bandage, apply firm pressure on the wound. 4. If the bleeding doesn’t stop or your pet remains unwell, contact your vet for advice or take your pet directly to your local vet.
 
Seizure
If your pet is moving their paws randomly and doesn’t respond when you call them, they may be having a seizure. 1. Call your pet’s name and see if they respond. Don’t hold them. Even the mildest of pets could seriously injure you as you try to comfort them. 2. Clear the area around your pet so they don’t hurt themselves. 3. To provide information for the vet, film the seizure and time its duration. 4. If the seizure lasts longer than two minutes, your pet needs to see a vet as soon as possible. Be very careful when moving your pet. If you’re concerned, call your vet for advice. 5. If the seizure ends within two minutes, try to keep your pet calm. You should still call your vet for advice. 6. Once the seizure is over, your pet may move around but they may be disorientated. Watch them to ensure they are safe.

Poisoning
If you think your pet has eaten something they shouldn’t: 1. Ring your vet to check if you need to take your pet in. 2. Take note of when the item was eaten and how much your pet had. Take the packaging with you to a vet, as well as some spare towels (in case your pet vomits). 3. If your pet vomits, check to see if any of the toxic product is in the vomit.4. Try to keep substances that are poisonous to your pet out of reach where possible. Common causes of poisoning in pets include: • Raisins • Grapes • Chocolate • Lily flowers (cats) • Garlic • Onion • Paracetamol • Ibuprofen • Slug bait • Rat bait • Anti-freeze • Mouldy food • Xylitol sweetener (often found in sweets or chewing gum)

Dehydration
Our pets can easily become dehydrated when they don’t eat or drink, when they vomit, or when they have diarrhoea or increased urination. But while dehydration is a common condition, it should be taken seriously. Extreme dehydration can lead to kidney and other organ failure, unconsciousness and even death in extreme cases. Signs your pet is dehydrated may include a loss of skin elasticity, loss of appetite, panting (though this is more subtle in cats), vomiting, reduced energy, dry or sunken looking eyes, a dry nose, dry sticky gums or saliva that appears thick like a paste. To check if your pet is dehydrated: 1. Check their skin elasticity. Pull the skin between their shoulder blades; it should spring back into shape. If the skin stays ‘tented’, this can be a sign they are dehydrated. 2. Offer them small amounts of water to drink every few minutes or offer them pieces of ice to lick. If your pet is not interested in the water, try mixing some water with their food, or mixing some flavouring (such as a teaspoon of chicken or beef broth) to their water. 3. If you’re concerned, take your pet to the vet. 

Heat Exposure
Like people, pets can suffer from heat stroke if left in hot places such as a car or if they’ve exercised in hot weather. The most telling sign of heat stroke in dogs and cats is excessive panting and drooling, though in cats this is more subtle. Your pet may also become agitated, weak and confused, have an increased heart rate, show breathing distress, vomit or have diarrhoea, or display uncoordinated movements. Eventually they may lose consciousness or collapse. If you suspect your pet has heat stroke: 1. Move them to a cool place and cool them as best you can with cold water, a fan or air conditioning. 2. Ensure they have plenty of fresh water available. 3. Even if your pet looks like they are recovering or you just suspect they have heat stroke, they should always be checked by a vet as soon as possible.

Road accident
1. After an animal has been hit by a vehicle, only approach if it’s safe to do so. Ask bystanders to stop traffic for you. 2. Gently assess your pet for any bleeding or any wounds (refer to ‘Bleeding’ section on page 3) and check if they are breathing. Take care when moving your pet; an animal in pain may bite. Gently move them off the road as soon as possible. 3. Find a clean towel to stop any bleeding. If there isn’t one at hand, you may need to ask those around you for assistance, or use items that are available such as clothes. 4. Take your pet to the vet immediately. Even if there are no visible signs of injury, they may have internal bleeding.

Snake, Spider or Insect Bite  
It’s not always possible to know when your pet has been bitten by a snake or insect. They may cry out or they may not even be aware of it. Signs a snake, spider or insect has bitten your pet include swelling in the face or a limp. 1. If you see a snake, spider or insect nearby, take a photo. 2. Keep calm to help soothe your pet and minimise their distress and movement; movement helps the venom spread around the lymphatic system. 3. Apply a pressure bandage over and around the bite site to help slow the venom from spreading to the heart. DO NOT apply a tourniquet as this may restrict blood flow. DO NOT attempt to remove the sting or clean the bite site. Some methods cause more harm than good and washing off the venom may prevent the vet from identifying the type of snake that bit your pet. Be careful when moving your pet; if they are in pain, they may bite. 4. Contact your vet or take your pet immediately to a vet for treatment.


Cat diseases:
Small Intestinal Diarrhea
Diarrhea from the small intestine typically presents as:
Large stool volumes
Weight loss due to malabsorption
Melena (black, tarry stools) indicating digested blood
Minimal urgency to defecate
Large Intestinal Diarrhea
Diarrhea from the large intestine tends to cause:
Frequent defecation with small stool volumes
Fresh blood (hematochezia) in the stool
Mucus in the stool
Straining and urgency to defecate

Causes:
Dietary Causes
Cats have delicate digestive tracts, and acute vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by a sudden change in diet or the ingestion of improper food.
Clinical Signs
Vomiting of partially digested food
Loose, watery, or semi-formed stools
Abdominal bloating and discomfort
Temporary loss of appetite
Diagnosis & Treatment
History & physical exam to rule out infectious causes
Supportive care, including temporary fasting (typically not exceeding 12 hours in adult cats).
Reintroduction of a bland diet (boiled chicken and rice)
Probiotics to restore gut flora
Electrolyte replacement in dehydrated cases
2. Food Allergies and Intolerances
A few cats develop persistent vomiting and diarrhea as a result of immune responses to certain proteins. In contrast to dietary indiscretion, food allergies are recurrent and persistent.
Diagnosis & Treatment
Elimination diet test (8–12 weeks on a new protein or hydrolyzed diet).
Strict dietary modification, permanently avoiding trigger ingredients.
3. Infectious Causes (Bacterial & Viral)
Bacterial infections in cats may result in very serious gastrointestinal signs with bloody diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration. Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli are the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens of feline gastroenteritis.
Viral Infections (Panleukopenia, Feline Coronavirus, FIP)
Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), or feline distemper, is a highly contagious viral illness causing abdominal vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea, fever, and leukopenia (white blood cell loss). Infected animals lose condition, become dehydrated and recumbent, and refuse food and water.
None of these viral infections have a specific antiviral treatment, and supportive therapy becomes crucial. Intravenous hydration, nutritional supplements, and antibiotics for secondary infection may be indicated.
Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders
Chronic vomiting and diarrhea may indicate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or chronic enteropathy (CE). Both involve persistent GI inflammation, though their causes may differ.
Gastrointestinal Obstructions
Intestines can become obstructed by foreign bodies (toys, hairballs, string), which causes vomiting, pain, and failure to produce stool.
Diagnosis & Treatment
X-rays or ultrasounds confirm obstruction.
Emergency surgery (enterotomy/gastrotomy) if blockage persists.
Systemic diseases (chronic kidney disease, liver disease, hyperthyroidism) can cause chronic vomiting and diarrhea.


Abnormal Feces:
What is abnormal faeces? 
“Faeces” is a Latin word meaning ‘dregs’ or ‘sediment’ and is also known as poo, poop, excrement, stool, bowel movement, defecation, fecal matter and countless other names. All these terms refer to the body’s waste matter that is formed in the intestines and discharged through the anus. Waste matter is comprised mainly of water, undigested food matter, fats, bacteria, salts, minerals and other substances.
While there is a huge range of what is normal when it comes to faeces, being familiar with your dog’s or cat’s toileting habits can be beneficial for the ongoing monitoring of its health. It is important to be aware of both the frequency of bowel movements and what a typical stool looks like when the animal is healthy, so that any subtle variations in regularity or appearance of the faeces will be recognised. The smell of the faeces is another indicator of health; although an odour is normal, healthy faeces should not smell too foul.
Abnormal frequency or appearance of the faeces can be symptomatic of a number of underlying conditions, ranging from digestive disorders to liver or kidney disease to dietary sensitivities to parasites. This explains why veterinarians regularly take a stool sample for examination; important information not just about digestive health but the overall health of the animal can be attained by analysing the faeces.
When it comes to appearance, faeces have four main “C” characteristics: colour, content, consistency, and coating.
Colour
In a healthy animal, faeces should be chocolate brown, although colour can range from deep brown to tan, with small variations occurring as a result of diet, hydration and food colourings. For example, diets high in fibre will often produce a lighter-coloured stool.
If abnormal colours persist for more than two stools, consult the veterinarian. Abnormal stool colours include:
Black or tar-coloured: may by a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract
Red streaks: can indicate bleeding in the lower digestive tract
Grey or yellow: may indicate issues with the pancreas, liver, or gallbladder
Green:  could indicate that the animal is eating grass, perhaps to soothe an upset stomach
White spots: may be a sign of worms
Content
The content of faeces is assessed by microscopically examining a sample. Abnormal faecal content may include:
Worms: long and skinny roundworms or little tapeworm segments, which are shiny, white, and about the size of rice and may possibly be moving.
Foreign materials (pica, the eating of non-food items, is not uncommon in dogs and cats), such as:
In dogs, grass, sock bits, plastic, rocks, cloth, and even money
In cats, pieces of cat toys or other household items, such as thread or dental floss.
Hair / fur: particularly in cats, big clumps of fur in the stool indicate overgrooming, which can occur as the result of stress, allergies, skin disease or even boredom. Hair is the most common item observed in the cat’s stool and is only considered abnormal if excessive quantities are present.
Coating
In a healthy animal, faeces should not have a coating or film over it. A coating may be observed as a trail on the ground after the stool is removed. A coating around the stool could indicate a condition such as bowel inflammation, or colitis. It often occurs in conjunction with diarrhoea.
 
Consistency
In a healthy animal, faeces should be well-formed, like play dough, i.e. not too hard or too soft or mushy. Ideally, it should be in log shapes with little segments in it so that if moved, it would break into smaller pieces.
The faecal scoring system is helpful in determining the consistency of the stool; the stool is graded from type 1 to type 7 or 8, where type 1 represents very hard, dry pellets and type 7 or 8 is liquid (see diagram below). According to this scale, the ideal stool has a score of 2. An overly hard stool can be painful to pass and may be a sign of dehydration, while an overly loose stool, or diarrhoea, can be a sign of an underlying disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease.
What is diarrhoea?
Diarrhoea is the rapid movement of ingested material through the intestine, resulting in one or more of the following:
Increased frequency of bowel movements
Loose, watery stools
Increased amount of stool
Diarrhoea is not a disease but a symptom of many different conditions, from minor illnesses to serious or even life-threatening diseases. It is not uncommon for dogs and cats, and there are many reasons why an animal might have it. Puppies, kittens, small dogs, and older animals are at risk of dehydration after a single episode of severe diarrhoea.
Acute diarrhoea
When an episode of diarrhoea comes and goes within a day or two, it is referred to as acute. It often occurs after a change in diet, unusual motion such as long car trip or air travel, or as a response to anxiety or a stressful situation.
 
Chronic diarrhoea
When a dog or cat experiences diarrhoea on a regular basis over the course of two or more weeks, it is referred to as chronic. Chronic diarrhoea may indicate a number of potentially serious health issues, ranging from organ dysfunction to parasites to infection.
 
What is constipation?
Constipation occurs when an animal struggles to defecate or produces small, hard, dry pellets with great effort. Older dogs and cats are more likely to experience constipation, although it can happen to any breed at any age. Ongoing constipation in animals should not be ignored, as there could be a serious cause such as an intestinal blockage or an underlying kidney disease. Additionally, extended periods of constipation can cause serious health problems.
Diet and regular exercise have an impact on normal stool formation and movement through the GI tract. Animals that are overfed, or fed excessive low-quality dry kibble, may consume more fibre and filler than their digestive systems can process. The longer the animal excretes hard, dry faeces, or no faeces, the greater the likelihood that constipation will turn into obstipation. Obstipation – constipation that resists treatment – occurs when there is a backup of faeces in the colon, a condition which can lead to a potentially life-threatening intestinal blockage.
 
Symptoms of abnormal faeces in dogs and cats
The most obvious sign of abnormal faeces is the presence of diarrhoea or constipation.
The stool of an animal with diarrhoea may have one or more of the following characteristics (characteristics will vary depending on the cause):
Watery, liquid, puddle-like consistency
Soft, pudding-like consistency
Soft, frothy consistency
Greasy consistency (mucus in the stool)
Black, tarry in colour (blood in the stool)
Red in colour (blood in the stool)
Pungent smell
Increased volume of stool
Increased frequency of bowel movements
Straining to evacuate
 
Other symptoms that can occur along with diarrhoea include:
Weight loss
Vomiting
Increased gas
Fever
Lethargy
Malaise
Loss of appetite
Dehydration
Abdominal pain
 
Symptoms of constipation include:
Infrequent or no defecation
Small, hard, dry pellets
Thin, ribbon-like stool
Straining or crying out in pain when trying to defecate
Hard, dry, small stools, possibly with some mucous or blood
Frequent trips to the litter box without producing a stool
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Lethargy
Vomiting
 
Is my dog pooping blood? What does blood look like in my cat’s poop?
Haematochezia, or blood in the stool, can be a frightening sight for any pet owner. The colour of the blood can range from a vivid red to dark red. Bright red blood is usually more obvious to the naked eye. The brighter red it is, the more likely the source is lower down the digestive tract, in or near the colon.
Darker blood in the stool may not be as noticeable. It usually stems from higher up in the digestive tract, as it has been through the process of digestion, which changes the colour from bright to dark; it may even appear to be almost black.
Both constipation and diarrhoea can be accompanied by blood in the stool. The appearance of blood in the stool could be a once-off occurrence or a sign of a potentially serious underlying condition. It is prudent to consult the veterinarian – and remember to take along a stool sample.
Causes of abnormal faeces in dogs and cats
Causes of diarrhoea
As diarrhoea is a symptom of a vast array of health problems, it also has multiple causes. Abnormal faeces do not always provide the veterinarian with a specific cause for the abnormality but will prompt further investigation.
Some of the causes of diarrhoea include:
Abrupt dietary changes
Ingestion of toxins
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Food intolerance, sensitivity or allergy
Gastroenteritis (infection and inflammation of the digestive system)
Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (excessive bacteria in the small intestine)
Intestinal parasites, e.g. worms, giardia (which is acquired when water contaminated with faeces is ingested)
Lymphangiectasia (a pathologic dilation of lymph vessels within the intestines of dogs)
Colitis (an inflammation or irritation of the colon)
Indiscriminate eating, pica (eating non-food items)
Tumours, cancer
Intestinal obstruction
Rectal polyps
Bacterial infections
Viral infections, e.g. parvovirus (a highly contagious viral disease that affects dogs; dog faeces are the most common source of the virus)
Pancreatic disease
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)
Stress, anxiety
Unusual motion, e.g. car or air travel
 
Diarrhoea can have different characteristics depending on its cause:
A soft stool with no visible blood or mucous might be caused by a dietary change, indiscriminate eating or an intestinal parasite such as
A greasy, grey stool may result from too much fat in the animal’s diet, which can trigger pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas that can range from very mild to life threatening).
A black, tarry stool typically indicates the presence of blood somewhere in the upper digestive system. It could be caused by injury to the GI tract from indiscriminate eating, or by a very serious disease such as cancer.
Watery diarrhoea can be caused by stress or a viral or parasitic infection and can lead very quickly to dehydration, especially in young and elderly animal.
A soft stool containing or coated with mucous may be caused by parvovirus or parasites.
A stool that starts off firm but is followed by soft or very loose second half of the bowel movement, can indicate a variety of causes including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, maldigestion, malabsorption, food intolerances, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dysbiosis (an imbalance in the types of gut bacteria) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBS).
 
Causes of Constipation
Constipation in dogs and cats can occur for several reasons, including:
Dehydration
Dietary issues
Kidney disease
Foreign objects blocking the colon, such as string, hairballs or bones
Diets that lack fibre or contain excessive fibre and filler
Problems within the colon, e.g. tumours or narrow places
Spine problems or pain
Feline megacolon — when the colon gets very large and its muscles no longer squeeze, making hard, dry stool build up inside
Dirty litter boxes
Inactivity
Painful defecation
Neurological disorders
Certain drugs
 
Causes of blood or mucus in faeces
Blood or mucus in the faeces may be caused by:
Dietary changes
Food intolerance
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Intestinal parasites such as Giardia
Infections
Trauma or abscess
Rectal polyps or tumours
Anal gland abscess or infection
Constipation or idiopathic feline megacolon
Poisons or toxins
Cancer
 How is abnormal faeces in dogs and cats diagnosed?
Diagnosis will usually include a medical history, physical examination and microscopic faecal evaluation. It is important to take a fresh stool sample to your consultation; it will help the vet identify potential underlying causes for the abnormal faeces. The stool sample will be examined for blood, parasites, bacteria, and other indicators of the cause. In more serious cases, x-rays, ultrasound, and blood and urine tests may also be conducted. It is important to determine the cause so the appropriate treatment can be given.
Medical history
The veterinarian will ask about the animal’s medical history including vaccinations, deworming treatments, contact with other dogs and cats, diet, access to garbage or toxins, and any medications. The more information the owner can provide, the easier it will be to make a diagnosis. A detailed account of the observed symptoms may help to narrow down the possible causes.
Physical examination
The veterinarian will perform a physical exam that may include measuring the animal’s temperature, checking the heart and respiration, looking in the mouth, palpating the abdomen, checking for dehydration and performing a rectal examination.
 
Laboratory and diagnostic tests
In almost all cases of diarrhoea, the veterinarian will recommend a faecal flotation, a routine veterinary test used to diagnose internal parasites or worms. If a bacterial infection is suspected, a faecal culture and sensitivity test are performed to determine what types of bacteria are present in the digestive tract. In cases of certain viral diseases, such as parvovirus, other tests of the faeces may aid in the diagnosis.
If the animal is showing generalised signs of illness, such as fever, vomiting and lethargy, a complete blood count and chemistry panel may be performed. Specialised blood tests may also be conducted if a particular disease is suspected. For certain diseases, the only way to make an accurate diagnosis is through microscopic examination of a biopsy (a piece of tissue or a sample of cells removed from the animal).
 
Diagnostic imaging
X-rays may be recommended if a tumour, foreign body, or anatomical problem is suspected. A barium study or ultrasound may also be recommended. Examinations using an endoscope or colonoscopy may be performed in certain cases.
 
Prognosis
Most healthy dogs and cats experience an occasional episode of loose stool or diarrhoea that resolves within 12 to 24 hours. The underlying cause in most of these cases is indiscriminate eating or stress. Diarrhoea associated with minor conditions usually has an excellent prognosis and can often be resolved quickly with simple treatments.
Diarrhoea that lasts for 24 to 48 hours usually has a good prognosis unless the animal is very young or elderly. But if diarrhoea continues for a longer period, dehydration can result, which can be dangerous. Even diarrhoea caused by mild illnesses may become serious if treatment is not initiated early enough to prevent severe fluid and nutrient losses. Any dog or cat can potentially become very ill from chronic bouts of diarrhoea.
Where diarrhoea is the result of serious or life-threatening illnesses such as organ system failure or cancer, the prognosis is less optimistic.
The prognosis for constipation is usually good, if treatment to alleviate the constipation is initiated promptly, because the longer faeces remains in the colon, the drier, harder and more difficult to eliminate they become.  If obstipation – constipation that resists treatment – occurs, the colon becomes packed with an uncomfortably large amount of faeces, causing unproductive straining, lethargy and appetite loss. In cats, this can result in the swelling of the colon and permanent loss of the colon’s motility and a complete inability to defecate.
 
Treatment for abnormal faeces in dogs and cats
Treatment will be determined by the underlying cause for the abnormal faeces. Because there are many possible causes, there are a variety of treatment options available, most commonly involving medication or dietary management. It is important to provide only medications that have been recommended or prescribed by the veterinarian.
 
Dietary modification
In most cases of diarrhoea, it is usually recommended to withhold food for 12 to 24 hours to rest the intestinal tract, while frequently providing small amounts of water. Thereafter, small quantities of bland, easily digestible solids are given for a few days. As the stool normalises, the animal’s regular diet is slowly reintroduced by combining it with the special diet over a few days.
In cases of constipation, a veterinarian-approved diet to modify in the fibre content and/or quality of the animal’s diet may be recommended. For some animals, a high fibre diet is beneficial, but for others, a low fibre diet works better, depending on the cause of the constipation. Increasing the water content of the diet may also be recommended, by switching from dry food to canned food or by mixing a little water in with the food.
The vet may also recommend a special diet if the cause is a food allergy or intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or colitis. In such cases, a permanent modified diet may be advised, in order to improve digestibility, avoid certain ingredients, or increase or decrease fibre or fat content of the diet.
 
Medication
Deworming treatment will be prescribed if intestinal worms are present and in most cases it is necessary to repeat the treatment one or more times over several weeks or months. It is also important to try to remove the worm eggs from the environment.
Antibiotics will be prescribed if the diarrhoea is caused by bacteria. They may also be given if the intestine has been damaged and there is a chance that the injury could allow bacteria from the intestine into the blood stream, possibly causing serious disease (septicaemia).
In some cases, medications may be provided to decrease motility, i.e., slow down the rate at which the ingested material moves through the intestine. These drugs should not be given if the animal has ingested a toxin or has a bacterial infection, therefore it is essential to have an accurate diagnosis before using these drugs.
In some cases, medication to control inflammation may be prescribed. In cases of constipation, laxatives, enemas or medication to increase the contractile strength of the large intestine may be recommended.
 
Rehydration fluids
Severe or prolonged diarrhoea can lead to significant dehydration and metabolic disturbances. If the animal is dehydrated, Hospitalisation may be necessary in order to provide fluids intravenously or subcutaneously. Oral fluids are often inadequate in such cases because they pass through the body too quickly to be sufficiently absorbed.
